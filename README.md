I'm kinda new to programming, but am trying my best to make something cool with what I know, and learn in the process! Currently, Assemble is a very simple alpha game with nothing but core mechanics, such as physics and moviment. You can watch the development in <Projects> or by watching closely to the commits. 
  
This is a cute platformer 2d, where you control a pink Blob named Bob. It can <Assemble>, that is, turn into one of the blocks you see around. Currently, including coins and score on the background, this is all you get from this early version. Right now, I'm working on the enemy system, adding a purple evil blob named Kiki.
